Social network data is all around us, and is easily represented as a graph. 
For example, if you think about your friend network on Facebook, each person can be represented as a node in the graph, 
and each friendship connection can be represented as an undirected edge between the nodes containing the people involved in the friendship. 
Twitter can be represented similarly, but with directed edges since following someone is a one-way relationship 
(you can follow someone without them following you back).

Using this graph abstraction, we can answer many interesting questions about the data underlying the graph. 
For example, we can automatically discover communities in a social network; 
we can recommend that people connect as friends based on the structure of their mutual acquaintances in the graph; 
we can figure out who the “influencers” are; and, we can look at how information might travel within and across groups.
